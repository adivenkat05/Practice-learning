# Practice - learning - C
###  Why I created this repository?

I started learning C a couple of years ago. Slowly, I started loosing interest in learning C.
So, I decided to relearn C back again. I used resource from internet and I started practicing every concepts that I learn day by day. 
I created this repository to take it as a reference.
